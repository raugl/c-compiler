## To do:
- Allocate literal strings and parse control sequences out of them.
- Implement preprocessor tokens.
- Write some more tests
- Make use of [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) to implement the parser.

## Done:
- Added error reporting to the lexer
- Improve the literal int token.
- Improve the literal float token.
- Investigate if a top-down descent approach would be better for the lexer.
